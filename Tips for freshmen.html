        <p>Freshmen transitioning to college will face challenges. They now must manage their time between staying healthy and finishing their work. They are responsible for eating healthy, sleeping on time, and maintaining healthy relationships. They must also be resourceful when focusing on their academics. The list below contains tips for freshmen computer science majors coming to Stevens.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Office hours</li>
            <p>Office hours with a TA or professor are invaluable. Seeing a professor or TA for homework help or just brushing up on topics from class can really go a long way. Being able to have things explained in that environment is much different and usually much clearer than when the material is taught in class. Showing up knowing what you are struggling with is beneficial to both parties. The student who shows up hopelessly lost on all topics will not fare as well as the one who knows what they are struggling with. While the sessions will not make up for missing lectures or recitations, they are still very helpful and should definitely be utilized.</p>
        <li>Asking questions</li>
            <p>Asking questions when you're confused is very important. Asking questions lets the professor or TA know that something may have been unclear. While potentially helping other students, it also strengthens your understanding of whatever was intially confusing. A question could fix a mistake made by a professor. And, above all, if you're paying to attend this fine institution, you may as well take advantage of being able to clear up something that you didn't understand.</p>
        <li>Academic Support Center</li>
            <p>The Academic Support Center is a really good resource for when you're struggling with a subject. They offer workshops on things like study skills and note taking. They also offer reviews for freshmen quizzes, which are handled by tutors in that subject. Additionally, the walk-in tutoring center offers help in a variety of different classes. For freshmen especially, the ASC is a priceless resource that can build to success.</p>
        <li>Stress management</li>
            <p>The workload in college is considerably more that high school, and it can cause a lot of stress. Managing that stress is very important, and can often be put on the back burner. Mental health is indescribably important. For most students, living on their own is a big step. The school's counseling and psychological services, referred to as CAPS, offers services to students like group therapy and urgent-care services. Keeping up with your mental health is just as important as keeping up with physical health.</p>
        <li>Time management</li>
            <p>Managing time in college is definitely something students need to master. The workload is larger than it was in high school. Making time for everything can be difficult. Balancing time between work, friends, and sleep can prove to be quite challenging. But, there are ways to do it well. Priorities are very important. Deciding which things are more important can make it easier when dividing your time. There is no right way to do it, but there are certainly ways to do it incorrectly. Not finishing work and not getting enough sleep will catch up to you, and  it will get messy. Ranking things in order of importance at the start will make everything down the line much simpler.</p>
