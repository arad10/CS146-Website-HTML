        <p>Blurb about freshmen heading into fall semester (Challenges they will face, transition to college, what to expect)</p>
        <p>Blurb about why the tips will help (Based on experience, getting off to a good start)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Office hours</li>
            <p>Office hours with a TA or professor are invaluable. Seeing a professor or TA for homework help or just brushing up on topics from class can really go a long way. Being able to have things explained in that environment is much different and usually much clearer than when the material is taught in class. Showing up knowing what you are struggling with is beneficial to both parties. The student who shows up hopelessly lost on all topics will not fare as well as the one who knows what they are struggling with. While the sessions will not make up for missing lectures or recitations, they are still very helpful and should definitely be utilized.</p>
        <li>Asking questions</li>
            <p>Asking questions when you're confused is very important.</p>
        <li>Walk in tutoring center</li>
            <p>The Walk in tutoring center is a really good resource for when you're struggling with a subject.</p>
        <li>Stress management</li>
            <p>The workload in college is considerably more that high school, and it can cause a lot of stress.</p>
        <li>Time management</li>
            <p>Managing time in college is paramount to everything else.</p>
    </ul>
        <p>Include descriptions for each tip. Explain importance and how to go about utilizing them.</p>
        <p>Good luck, maybe something about contacting the creators</p>
