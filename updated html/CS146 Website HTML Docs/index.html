        <h2>Why is Computer Science important?</h2>
        <img src="cs.PNG" alt="ComputerScience"/>
        <p>Computer Science has become important in everyone's daily lives. Can you imagine a world without the internet?
            Thanks to Computer Science, over the years, Computer Scientists cultivated the internet. Without the internet, everything
            we do now would be much more difficult like finding a source for that essay you have due tomorrow. Imagine having to handwrite
            every paper you turn in? You can't right? Thanks to Computer Science, all of the technology we have is consumer friendly and allows
            for people's lives to be changed by being able to perform tasks and desires much easier and faster. Additionally, through the creativity
            and opportunistic thinking of computer scientists, they have learned to manipulate code into making the daily lives
            of people easier. For example, Uber has made obtaining a taxi anywhere in the United States much easier than having to hassle
            with hailing a cab or dealing with a taxi service. Uber has even enabled "taxi-less" regions to have taxis available. Without Computer Science, Uber
            would cease to exist along with every piece of software you use. Computer Science both solves problems in all areas and fields to the daily lives of 
            regular people. Computer Science has become the foundation for the advanced society we live in today. Computer Scienc is important because it works in solving
            problems and improving solutions to society's drastic problems.

        <h2>Why Major In Computer Science at Stevens?</h2>
        <img src="programming.PNG" alt="Programming"/>
        <p>The demand for Computer Scientists have risen exponentially over the last two decades, and it is not without reason. Now, I won't bore you
            with a block of text but instead, a cool list of why you should major in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The freedom you have. As computer scientists, you can go into almost any field/company that suits you for a job</li>
            <li>The high salary (refer to the salary table below for Stevens graduates specifically)</li>
            <li>Your passion for techology! Computer Science is a heavily technological field that works with how a computer works and guides you into how to make your own
                programs, websites, etc.</li>
        </ul>
