    <p>Address of Stevens Institute of Technology: 1 Castle Point Terrace, Hoboken, New Jersey 07030</p>
    <p><b>Upper Campus VS Lower Campus: </b>Upper campus holds many non-academic buildings such as residence halls, dining locations, and the library. As a rule of thumb, if you are close to or at the top of the hill, you are in upper campus. Lower campus is mainly composed of academic buildings, so this is where you will have most of your classes. Lower campus also has most professors' offices. As a rule of thumb, if you are close to or at the bottom of the hill, you are in lower campus.</p>

    <p>This map may be a little outdated, but here you can see the general layout of Stevens Institute of Technology's campus. This map is missing the North building and includes buidings that either do not exist anymore or are not going to exist in the near future, such as the Lieb building.</p>

    <h3><u>Academic Buildings</u></h3>
    
    <b>Babbio Center</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "Babbio%201.jpg" alt = "Babbio Center Picture 1" width = "196" height = "256" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Babbio 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>Babbio Center is a relatively new building, and it shows. You'll have classes and recitations in state-of-the-art classrooms and labs with lots of variety in room structure. Coming soon is a parking garage built into the side of Babbio Center, so commuters will soon be able to commute right to class in this great building. Babbio Center is located at the end of the straight road that runs through upper campus, just past the archway.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>McLean Hall</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "McLean%201.jpg" alt = "McLean Hall" width = "240" height = "196" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "McLean 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>McLean Hall is the site of many mathematics and science courses, and it is located right behind Babbio Center. McLean Hall is fairly standard, having normal classroom setups for math and some science labs as well.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Carnegie Laboratory</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "Carnegie%201.jpg" alt = "Carnegie Laboratory Picture 1" width = "256" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Carnegie 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>Carnegie Laboratory is all about the sciences, having many science classrooms and labs.</p><!--Find more information, I don't know much lol-->
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Morton-Peirce-Kidde Complex</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "Peirce%201.jpg" alt = "Peirce Building" width = "256" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Peirce 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>The Morton-Peirce-Kidde complex, also referred to as the MPK complex, is made up of three buildings that are connected on the second floor. These buildings are fairly similar, all having relatively large classrooms with traditional setups. The Morton building is mainly focused on art, also having some recitations for other classes. The Peirce building is mainly focused on literature, mostly having CAL classes but also having other classes that require larger classrooms such as web design (CS146). The Kidde building is mostly focused on music, having a music tech lab on the second floor for music tech students.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Burchard Building</b> <br/><br/>
    <img src = "Burchard%201.jpg" alt = "Burchard Building" width = "240" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Burchard 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>The Burchard building is home to Burchard 118, which is a newly-renovated lecture room near the entrance that is commonly used for review sessions and other meetings.</p><!--Find more information, I know nothing about this place lol-->
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Edwin A. Stevens Hall</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "EAS%201.jpg" alt = "Edwin A. Stevens Center Picture 1" width = "256" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "EAS 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>This building is often referred to as the "EAS building", and it is located across from McLean Hall, being well within lower campus. The main entrance to the EAS building leads directly to DeBaun Auditorium, which holds many events (especially in the beginning).</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3><u>Freshman Residence Halls</u></h3>
    
    <b>Castle Point Hall</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "CPH%201.jpg" alt = "Castle Point Hall Picture 1" width = "192" height = "256" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "CPH 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>This is the first residence hall you'll see when entering Stevens from the main entrance, and it is also the freshman dorm that is furthest into upper campus. This dorm has a bathroom within each dorm room and is pretty nice overall in comparison to some of the other residence halls, so this one is highly favorable but also very hard to get into. Additionally, this residence will be the furthest away from the academic buildings and therefor your classes, so keep that in mind when making your room selection choices.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Davis Hall</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "Davis%201.jpg" alt = "Davis Hall" width = "256" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Davis 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>Davis Hall is the closest to lower campus, being closest to the academic buildings as well. It's located right next to Hayden Hall, being just down the hill from it. Davis is generally a good residence hall, with half of the rooms having a great view of New York City. Each floor has a bathroom that is shared by everyone on that floor. Davis Hall is pretty generic, but not in a bad way, as each aspect of the dorm is pretty good overall.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Humphreys Hall</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "Humphreys%201.jpg" alt = "Humphreys Hall Picture 1" width = "256" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Humphreys 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>Humphreys Hall is a little out of the way, being located behind Palmer Hall (an upperclassmen residence hall) when going from the center of campus. Humphreys Hall is well within upper campus like Castle Point Hall but is a little closer to the academic buildings, but has bathrooms that are shared by the floor instead of bathrooms within each room.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Jonas Hall</b><br/><br/>
    <img src = "Jonas%201.jpg" alt = "Jonas Hall" width = "240" height = "160" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Jonas 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>Jonas Hall is a bit out of the way, being right next to Humphreys Hall.</p><!--Get more information about this hall, I know nothing lol-->
    
    <hr>
    
    <b>Hayden Hall</b><br/><br/><!--This building will be demolished, though-->
    <img src = "Hayden%201.jpg" alt = "Hayden Hall Picture 1" width = "256" height = "192" border = "3"><br/><!--This is "Hayden 1.jpg" in the files-->
    <p>Hayden Hall is the closest to Howe center, being only a minute's walk away. It's in the middle of upper campus, and it's somwhat close to most of the academic buildings. Hayden Hall also has Hayden lounge on the first floor, which is open to students 24/7. Beware the downsides, however. First of all, the air conditioning units are loud and not very effective, and they prevent the windows from being opened. Also, the only men's bathroom with showers in on the second floor, which is a women's floor, so keep that in mind. You don't want to be put in this hall. If you want to be closer to academic buildings, choose Davis Hall over Hayden Hall.</p>

    <h3><u>Places to Eat</u></h3>
    
    <b>Pierce Dining Hall</b><br/>
    
    <p>This is the main dining hall on campus, and it's located on the 2nd floor of the Howe center. Note that this not in the Peirce building, but is instead very far away from it. The names are confusing, but they are spelled differently, so make sure you look at the spelling when being directed to either Pierce or Peirce.</p><br/>
    
    <b>Red and Gray Cafe</b><br/>
    
    <p>This cafe offers other options for what to eat, and it's located just to the left of the main entrace of the Burchard building. Pop by here if you want a quick bagel or muffin or something in the morning. They serve pretty decent coffee, as well.</p><br/>
    
    <b>America's Cup</b><br/>
    
    <p>America's Cup is a coffee shop that also serves salads and sandwiches, and is located in the same building as the Samuel C. Williams Library in upper campus. There is a hallway in the building that connects the library to America's Cup, so you can easily walk between the two without a hassle.</p>
    
    <b>Colonel John's</b><br/>
    
    <p>Colonel John's is a popular alternative to Pierce Dining Hall, serving mainly salads, burritos, and sandwiches. The food here is pretty good, but make sure to bring your receipt up to the counter since that is what puts your order in queue for being prepared for you. Colonel John's is located on the first floor in the Howe center, being down the hall and to the right from the main entrance.</p>
